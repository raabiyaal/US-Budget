# US-Budget 

Raabiyaal Ishaq 

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
My current goal is to visualize key US fiscal trends to understand how government finances have changed over time. While the initial proposal included projected figures, the goal has now shifted to presenting only historical data.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
I have been able to find clean and well-structured data, so I did not face any data-related challenges. I have however not used all 3 data links I had mentioned in my proposal.

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

1. US Federal Budget: This chart shows US federal receipts, outlays, and the resulting budget surplus or deficit from 1960 onward. The green and red shaded areas highlight periods of surplus and deficit, while the blue and orange lines compare overall spending and revenue trends over time.

## What form do you envision your final narrative taking? (e.g. An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)

Most probably a site or html page. I might prefer moving forward with this/or similar data for the interactive project.
