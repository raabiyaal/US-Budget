## Description

Topic: U.S. Federal Budget Trends — Revenues, Expenditures, and Forecast Accuracy

My project will visualize how the U.S. federal budget has evolved over time, focusing on:

1. Trends in total revenues, expenditures, and budget deficits from 2000 to 2024.
2. The composition of both revenues (individual, corporate, payroll, etc.) and expenditures (defense, health, social security, interest, etc.).
3. A comparison between projected budget figures and the actual realized results to assess the accuracy of federal budget projections.

## Questions

Is it okay to present a visualization in a way similar to what I’ve found elsewhere, while ensuring that the visualization itself is entirely created by me?
